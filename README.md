The bus service at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) faces several challenges that impact its usability and reliability for students and staff. The timing of buses is inconsistent and frequently off schedule, causing frustration and inconvenience for passengers. Additionally, the bus schedule itself is complicated and difficult for newcomers to understand, as it uses undefined abbreviations for landmark destinations, making it unclear what they represent. Planning trips within the campus is further complicated by a lack of familiarity with bus routes, poorly labeled campus maps, and the absence of details about intermediate bus stops along the routes. These issues collectively make navigating UTMâ€™s bus system challenging and inefficient for its users.

To address the challenges stated above, we proposed to create a comprehensive web application to improve navigation and convenience for users. The web app will feature real-time bus tracking, enabling users to monitor bus locations and anticipate their arrival at stops along the route. An interactive map will be integrated to display bus routes clearly, assisting users in exploring UTM and planning their trips efficiently. Additionally, the app will compile essential resources, such as shuttle bus maps, schedules provided by UTM Fleet, and instructional videos to familiarize users with bus route locations and key landmarks. To ensure continuous improvement and user satisfaction, a feedback module will be included, allowing users to report issues, suggest improvements, and share their experiences with the service.
